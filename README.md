# The visual display of quantitative information
## by Edward Tufte

### Chapter 1: Graphical Excellence

<ol>
    <li><strong>In statistical graphics, what excellence consists of?</strong></li>
        Consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Mention two things that a graphical display should do:</strong></li>
        - show the data.<br>
        - induce the viewer to think the susbtance rather than about methodology, graphic design or something else<br>
        - avoid distorting what the data have to say<br>
        - present many numbers in a small space<br>
        - make large data sets coherent<br>
        - encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data<br>
        - reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure<br>
        - serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration<br>
        - be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the fundamental graphical designs?</strong></li>
        - data maps<br>
        - time-series<br>
        - space-time narrative designs<br>
        - relational graphics<br><br>
    <li><strong>Which are the most extensive data maps that display statistical information in a powerful way?</strong></li>
        The cancer atlas, and the count of the galaxies.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What gives the natural ordering of the time scale to the design of the time-series plot?</strong></li>
        A strength and efficiency of interpretation found in no other graphic arrangement.<br><br>
    <li><strong>For what is best the time-series plot?</strong></li>
        For big data sets with real variability.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the problem with time-series?</strong></li>
        That the simple passage of time is not a good explanaroty variable.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the solution to the problem of time series?</strong></li>
        The addition of more variables, such as spatial dimensions, into the graphic design.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is graphical excellence?</strong></li>
        It is the well-designed presentation of interesting data - a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 2: Graphical Integrity

<ol>
    <li><strong>How a graphic does not distort?</strong></li>
        When the visual representation of the data is consistent with the numerical representation.<br><br>
    <li><strong>When do tables outperform graphics?</strong></li>
        When reporting on small data sets of 20 numbers or less.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How is measured the violation of the first principle that leads to graphic misrepresentation?</strong></li>
        It is measured by the Lie Factor, which is the size of effect shown in graphic divided by the size of effect in data.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the recommendation about the numbers of dimensions?</strong></li>
        That the number of variable dimensions that wants to be presented should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Mention two of the six principles that enhace graphical integrity:</strong></li>
        - The representation of numbers should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.<br>
        - Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.<br>
        - Show data variation, not design variation.<br>
        - In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.<br>
        - The number of information-carrying dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.<br>
        - Graphics must not quote data out of context.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 3: Sources of graphical integrity and sophistication

<ol>
    <li><strong>What are the primary causes of inept graphical work?</strong></li>
    Lack of quantitative skills of professional artists, people think that statistical data are boring, and people think that graphics are only for the unsophisticated reader.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the consequences of mediocre graphical work?</strong></li>
    Over-decorated and simplistic designs, tiny data sets, and big lies.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How can we achieve graphical sophistication?</strong></li>
    By using relational graphics.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Why relational graphics are essential to competent statistical analysis?</strong></li>
    Because they confront statements about cause and effect with evidence, showing how one variable affects another.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the skills that graphical competence demand?</strong></li>
    Substantive skills, statistical skills, and artistic skills.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 4: Data-ink and graphical redesign

<ol>
    <li><strong>To what data graphics should draw the viewer's attention?</strong></li>
        To the sense and substance of the data, not to something else.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the fundamental principle of good statistical graphics?</strong></li>
        Above all else show the data.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What it means maximize the data-ink ratio, within reason?</strong></li>
        The larger the share of a graphic's ink devoted to data, the better.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the two erasing principles?</strong></li>
        Erase non-data-ink, and erase redundant data-ink, within reason.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What thing generate redundant data-ink?</strong></li>
        Gratuituous decoration, reinforcement of the data measures, bilateral symmetry of data measures.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Why bilateral symmetry generated redundant data-ink?</strong></li>
        Because it doubles the space consumed by the design in a graphic, without adding new information.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the uses of redundancy?</strong></li>
        Giving a context and order to complexity, facilitating comparisons over various parts of the data, creating an aesthetic balance. <br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the five principles in the theory of data graphics produce substantial changes in graphical design?</strong></li>
        - Above all else show the data.<br>
        - Maximize the data-ink ratio.<br>
        - Erase non-data-ink.<br>
        - Erase redundant data-ink.<br>
        - Revise and edit.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 5: Chartjunk: Vibrations, grids, and ducks

<ol>
    <li><strong>What are some of the purposes of decoration?</strong></li>
        - To make the graphic appear more scientific and precise.<br>
        - To enliven the display.<br>
        - To give the designer an opportunity to exercise artistic skills. <br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the three types of chartjunk?</strong></li>
        - Unintentional optical art.<br>
        - The dreaded grid.<br>
        - The self-promoting graphical duck.<br><br>
    <li><strong>On what relies the contemporary optical art?</strong></li>
        It relies on moir√© effects, in which the design interacts with the physiological tremor of the eye to produce the distracting apperance of vibration and movement.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What should we do with grids?</strong></li>
        The grid should usually be muted or completely suppressed so that its presence is only implicit, unless it compete with the data.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How do we deal with grids in a correct way?</strong></li>
        The grid should be muted relative to the data, this can be done by using a gray grid with a delicated line.<br><br>
    <li><strong>When can we call the graphic a duck?</strong></li>
        - When a graphic is taken over by decorative forms or computer debris.<br>
        - When the data measures and structures become Design Elements.<br>
        - When the overall design purveys Graphical Style rather than quantitative information.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 6: Data-ink maximization and graphical design

<ol>
    <li><strong>In what rests the choice of the best overall arrangement design of a plot?</strong></li>
    It rests on statistical and aesthetic criteria.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is relevant for the use of parallel schematic plot designs in informal, explanatory data analysis?</strong></li>
    The large reduction in the amount of drawing because the research worker's time should be devoted to matters other than drawing lines.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the most common techniques for erasing and data-ink maximizing?</strong></li>
    No frame, no vertical axis, no ticks, and the white grid.<br><br>
    <li><strong>As going through what do graphics are almost always going to improve?</strong></li>
    As they go through editing, revision, and testing against different design options.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What generate the principles of maximizing data-ink and erasing?</strong></li>
    They generate graphical alternatives and also suggest a direction in which revisions should move.<br><br>
</ol>

### Chapter 7: Multifunctioning Graphical Elements

        - The blots of a blot map.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What leads to data-based labels?</strong></li>
    Data-based coordinate lines.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How numbers play a double-function?</strong></li>
    - When used to name  things (like an identification number).<br>
    - Reflect an ordering.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How can we eliminate eye-work with a double-functioning maneuver?</strong></li>
    By turning the coordinate labels into data measures.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is a sure sign of a puzzle graphic?</strong></li>

</ol>

### Chapter 8: Data density and small multiples

<ol>
    <li><strong>How can numbers be organized into a graphic?</strong></li>
    They can be organized into a data matrix of observations by variables. <br> <br>
    <li><strong>What is data density?</strong></li>
    It is the size of the graphic in relation to the amount of data displayed.<br><br>
    <li><strong>On what should often be based data graphics?</strong></li>
    They should often be based on large rather than than small data matrices and have a high rather than low data density. <br><br>
    <li><strong>What are some data-reduction techniques and what they can do in overcrowded graphics?</strong></li>
    Averaging, clustering, and smoothing. They can thin the numbers out before plotting.<br><br>
    <li><strong>Why data-rich designs are important?</strong></li>
    They give a context and credibility to statistical evidence.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the principle for high-density graphics?</strong></li>
    Maximize the data density and the size of the data matrix, within reason.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How can we increase data density using the shrink principle?</strong></li>
    By reducing the area of the graphic.<br><br>
    <li><strong>For what are used small multiples?</strong></li>
    For narrative content, showing shifts in the relationship between variables as the index variable changes; revealing interaction or multiplicative effects.
    
</ol>

### Chapter 9: Aesthetics and technique in data graphical design

<ol>
    <li><strong>What are the two key elements in a good design?</strong></li>
    Simplicity of design, and complexity of data.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the basic structures for showing data?</strong></li>
    The sentence, the table, and the graphic.<br><br>
    <li><strong>For what are preferably the use of tables?</strong></li>
    For many small data sets.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the principle of data-text integration?</strong></li>
    Data graphics are paragraphs about data and should be treated as such.
    <li><strong>What is the friendly data graphic?</strong></li>
    The one that displays such care in design that it is particularly accessible and open to the eye, as if the designer had the viewer in mind at every turn while constructing the graphic.<br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the data and line weight?</strong></li>
    The greater the meaning is given to the greater line weight.<br><br>
    <li><strong>How should be tending the graphics?</strong></li>
    Graphics should tend toward the horizontal, greater in length than height.<br><br>
    
    
</ol>
